## Creating Standalone Applications

1. **For Golang**:

   - Bundling in Go is relatively straightforward due to its static compilation. You can use tools like `go build` to create binaries that can run independently on various platforms. Additionally, you can use tools like `pkg` or `goreleaser` to package your Go application, including the Rust binary, into a single executable.

2. **For Rust**:

   - Rust also produces standalone binaries when you compile your code. This makes distribution easy. You can use tools like `cargo bundle` or `cargo rpm` to create installable packages for various platforms.

3. **For Python**:
   - **Standalone Applications**: You can create standalone applications using tools like `PyInstaller`, `cx_Freeze`, or `py2exe`. These tools bundle your Python application, along with a minimal Python interpreter, into a single executable file.
   - **Isolated Environment**: For a minimal Python instance to run your high-level wrapper, you can configure `PyInstaller` to include only the necessary dependencies, thus minimizing bloat.
   - **Considerations**: Keep in mind that while PyInstaller can package your app, the resulting executable can be larger than both Go and Rust binaries due to the inclusion of the Python interpreter and standard library.

### Example: Using PyInstaller

Here's a basic example of how to use `PyInstaller` to create a standalone executable for your Python high-level wrapper:

1. **Install PyInstaller**:

   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Create the Executable**:
   Navigate to your Python script directory and run:

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "images;images" main.py
   ```

   - `--onefile`: Creates a single executable.
   - `--add-data`: Includes additional data files (like images) in the executable.

3. **Running the Executable**:
   After running the command, you'll find the executable in the `dist` folder. You can distribute this file without needing a Python installation on the target machine.

### Conclusion

The performance of your high-level implementations may not vary dramatically because they serve mainly as wrappers for the Rust binary, which does the heavy lifting. Creating standalone applications is feasible for all languages involved, but the process varies in complexity and output size. Python may require more effort to keep the bundle minimal compared to Go and Rust, but tools like `PyInstaller` can help package everything you need into a single executable.

Testing and optimization will ultimately guide you toward the best performance and distribution strategy for your applications.
